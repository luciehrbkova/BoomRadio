            <p>There isn't a lot of room for newcomers in the fighting game genre. Veteran franchises like 
                Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat, and Guilty Gear have dominated the space for years, 
                so the new challengers that do choose to step into the ring usually have the backing of a 
                popular license. Granblue Fantasy Versus is just that kind of rookie fighter; it's based on 
                a property that's incredibly popular in Japan thanks to a successful mobile gacha (virtual 
                capsule-toy vending machine) game with RPG hooks, but relatively unknown everywhere else. 
                Versus is, for all intents and purposes, Granblue Fantasy's debut on the world stage.

                Developed by Arc System Works--known for excellent fighting game adaptations of Dragon 
                Ball Z and Persona 4--Granblue Fantasy Versus has a strong core thanks to unorthodox gameplay 
                mechanics that delicately balance depth with approachability, while introducing interesting 
                new ideas of its own. The extra flourishes that serve as a nod to fans or aim to adhere to 
                RPG roots whiff on occasion, but the experience as a whole holds its own thanks to the 
                strength of its fundamentals.
                
                ArcSys has made strides in improving the approachability of its anime fighters more with 
                simpler inputs and easier-to-understand systems, but for Granblue Fantasy Versus, it has 
                moved away from the breakneck pace, air-dashing-oriented, aggressive playstyle of anime 
                fighters to something more traditional. As a ground-based fighting game, Versus has a much 
                slower pace of play and places heavier focus on normals and special moves instead of partner 
                assists and lengthy touch-of-death combos. In that respect, it can be likened more closely 
                to Capcom fighting games such as Street Fighter. The emphasis is on timing and spacing your
                 attacks properly to create opportunities for follow-ups or set up situations where you have 
                 an advantage, but not necessarily an almost guaranteed victory. At a higher level, it's 
                 about footsies, precisely executed mixups, smart use of the universal overhead, and the 
                 occasional frame trap. For newcomers--of which there's likely to be many, given the popularity 
                 of Granblue Fantasy--it's much more stable ground to find footing. Fighting game veterans will 
                 naturally have an advantage, but for everyone else, the mountain doesn't seem as steep to 
                 climb, so the idea of walking the path to mastery is much more inviting.</p>
